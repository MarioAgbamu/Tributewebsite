    Surprisingly, as a rookie, he did not exhibit any stage freight but quickly rose to become a dependable defender for his school, earning himself the nickname, Star Lager. He explained: “They gave me the name because it was difficult for opposing players to beat me in my central defensive role.
    “To my amazement, I did things on the field that I never thought I could do and this strengthened my resolve to continue in that path. Another brother of mine, Buxton Agbamu, who also played table tennis, also gave me his total support.”
    After completing his three years at the modern school, he moved over to Anglican Grammar School, Obulu-Uku, where he continued playing football and combining it with his educational pursuit. His new school had a good team and he teamed up with the Emeni brothers – Arnold and Meshack – who were strong members of the side.
    Arnold, who was also the senior prefect of the school, according to Agbamu, took a special likeness in him because of his abilities on the pitch. Just like every other athlete, he was also exempted from the early morning manual labour as they were always on the pitch practicing to sharpen their skills while others were busy at their tasks.
    The school principal, he said, was also a big source of encouragement and made sure that the athletes got the best welfare: “Our principal at Anglican was very good and made sure all the athletes got special care. He provided equipment and it was here that I got my first pair of boots through the principal.

    “Our greatest rival then was St Anthony’s College, Ubulu-Uku (Ekwumekwu). Any game involving both schools was fiercely contested and it was always difficult to separate the two teams. I made sure I was always at my best in these games because it defined one’s ability. My opponents knew I didn’t take things for granted and whenever they saw me on the pitch, they knew I was there for serious business.”
    In 1963, after he left Anglican, he was inspired to join the Nigeria Police by his elder brother, Bright, who was also a police officer. He brought the younger Agbamu to the Police College in Ikeja, Lagos, to write the entrance exams. He was successful and he was admitted alongside many others but little did he know that it was the end of his exploits on the football field.
    Fate brought him into contact with Sam Igun, who talked him into abandoning the football pitch for the track: “I must say that I had wanted to follow the step of my brother, who also played for the Police team, but after I met Igun, I abandoned that dream and took to the tracks. He was the one who found out that I was good in the sprints and hurdles and he encouraged me to do the 100, 200 and, 400 metres, which became my main event.”
    Training with Igun was tedious but he was prepared to give his all to his newfound love. According to him, “at the college, I enjoyed training with Igun, though he always woke me up at 5a.m to commence training. It was difficult but I persevered because I wanted to be successful. I had a senior officer, Umera, a javelin thrower who also encouraged me.”

    As a trainee, he enjoyed privileges because of his involvement in sports. He noted: “I did not wash toilet or cut grass as a trainee because I was always in training and was a member of the relay team even before I was commissioned. I also got rapid promotion and left the police in 1973 as a sergeant when I went to pick up an appointment with the Mid-West State under Brig.-Gen. Samuel Ogbemudia (rtd).”
    He caught the eye of the national team selectors while still in the police in 1968, when he was picked to represent the country at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico – where he did the 400 metres, an experience he described as an eye opener. He also made the cut for the Munich Olympics in 1972 but the Nigerian team was recalled after the Black September group held members of the Isreali Olympic team hostage before killing them.
    In 1970, Agbamu was also in the Nigerian team to the Commonwealth Game in Edinburgh. Though he did not also win a medal at this level, he was grateful to have been part of the team. After, he took up employment at the Mid-West Sports Council, where he combined athletics with coaching.
    “I actually enjoyed working in the Mid-West. I was employed as an athlete but because of my influence among the athletes, I also did a little bit of coaching before Jimi Omagbemi was brought in from the United States,” he added.
    The former police officer was the captain of the Mid-West team that won the 1973 National Sports Festival (NSF) in Lagos, where he also clinched four gold medals to emerge the best athlete. He said: “I was very happy after winning gold in the 400, 100, 4X400 and 4X100 metres. The team also finished first and it was due to the influence of Omagbemi, who was brought in from the United States. He was a very good coach and I so much believe I gained so much from him.”
    In 1975, he travelled to Canada with coach Dibia to compete at a meet but was not allowed due to racial problem. However, he came back to join the Mid-West team in Lagos for the NSF, where he competed in the 400 and 4×400 metres, winning gold medals.

    Another veritable medal hunting ground for Agbamu was the annual Nigeria/Ghana Challenge, where he dominated the 400 metres hurdles and the relay with the team. He was not oblivious of the fact that he would not challenge for honours for life, so he did a two-year training course in Missouri, U.S., where he announced his retirement from athletics.
    He came back to the country the same year and was assigned to take over coaching job at the Mid-West State, where he led the team to win the NSF’s overall winners’ medal. He recalled: “My first outing as a coach was a huge success. I won with my team and also discovered Felix Madi, who was nicknamed Beautiful Legs. He was the first Nigerian to run the 400 metres under 46 seconds.
    “Working with the Mid-West as an athlete and a coach was very fulfilling because it was from there that I was picked to become the athletics coach of the country, where I also had memorable moments,” he added.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of such moments was at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, where he led the quartet of Innocent Egbunike, Sunday Uti, Moses Igbusien and Rotimi Adebayo to win the bronze. He explained: “The quartet was a fantastic bunch and they knew they had to train hard to win a medal in Los Angeles.
    “We were in Germany for a six-week training tour and I occasionally joined them in training. We them moved to Casablanca and later to the U.S. for the Olympics. Watching these athletes succeed was like seeing your child growing up and succeeding. It shows that whatever you had taught them was working and your efforts were not in vain.
    “We had a strong bond. We ate together and I also slept in the same room with them and we trained together. They really made me a proud coach, especially Egbunike, who was a highly disciplined athlete. In fact, the success we had was because all others wanted to be like him.”

    In 1990, Agbamu was also the track and field coach to the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, with the likes of Henry Amike, Yusuf Ali and many others. Nigeria won three gold, four silver and three bronze medals and, “for me, that was another successful year.” He also took the team to the World Championship in Tokyo in 1991 before retiring from coaching. He added: “After the Tokyo Games, I knew I had done my best as an athlete and a coach. It was time for me to say goodbye to coaching, which I did without any regret.”
    Retired but not tired, he became a sports administrator with Delta State, drawing up programmes for coaches to aid the development of sports and athletes. He said: “I cannot allow the experience I have garnered over the years to just rot away because I am no longer coaching, so I decided to go into administration where I work with coaches to draw up programmes that will be of benefit to the athletes.
    “I believe so much in the grassroots where talents that will take over from the ageing ones can be discovered. The government needs to pump money into this area if we hope to make any headway in sports development. There was a swimming tourney held recently in Port Harcourt, where the South Africans won virtually all the medals, which shows that we must begin to hunt for talents.”
    Agbamu, who is an apostle of the saying, “Practice what you preach,” also goes out to train athletes, especially if he sees that the coaches are not doing it right. He added that he could not understand why none of his nine children did sports.
    The former versatile runner, who also earned himself the nickname, Grandpa of Nigerian Coaches, is currently the vice president of the National Association of Technical Officials (NATO) in track and field. He described his experience running for Nigeria as “a great experience wearing the national colours. It was not about money but the recognition I got internationally.”
